I am a red teamer with 1 year of experience in web security. I am always looking to learn and expand my knowledge in the field of information security. Currently, I am working as an infosec intern, where I have the opportunity to apply my skills and continue learning from my colleagues.

In my work as a red teamer, I have gained a deep understanding of web vulnerabilities and how to exploit them. I am skilled in identifying and assessing security risks in web applications and providing recommendations for improvement.

I am dedicated to staying up-to-date on the latest threats and trends in the world of infosec, and I am always seeking out new challenges to test my skills. If you have a project that could benefit from my expertise in red teaming and web security, don't hesitate to reach out!
